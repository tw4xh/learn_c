# Study notes
This is the path of my c learning!
I am leaning C with the book "**C Programming Language, 2nd Edition**"

## Linux command:

1. mkdir: create folder
2. touch: create file
3. vim: edit file
4. :x : save and close the file
5. cc xxx.c: compile the c file. The output file will be "a.output"
6. ./a.out: run the compiled file

## 1 - hello world:
1. The program begins executing at the beginning of main
2. **"\n"** is for newline
3. **printf** is a library function that prints output
